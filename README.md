## 🧠 What I Do (At an Architectural Level)

* Design **production-grade React Native architectures**
* Build **reusable platforms, CLIs, and design systems**
* Bridge **Java/Kotlin ↔ React Native ↔ JSI/C++**
* Solve **native performance & memory safety issues**
* Mentor engineers and students into **industry-ready developers**

## 🔥 Open Source Impact

### 🧩 React Native Skia (Shopify)

**Core Contributor**

* Fixed a **native C++ dangling pointer bug** in the Skia JSI layer
* Root cause: temporary UTF-8 string lifetime misuse triggering
  `-Wdangling-assignment-gsl` and breaking Android builds
* Solution: preserved backing string storage before `c_str()` usage
* Result: **Android native builds stabilized**, no API or behavior change
* PR reviewed and approved by core maintainer **@wcandillon**

## 🎯 Real-World Engineering Challenges I’ve Solved

1. **Reverse-engineering an outdated Android SDK**
   Adapted an unmaintained POS Android SDK for React Native by
   studying native documentation and extending the NPM package.

2. **Reliable emulator detection without third-party libraries**
   Implemented a custom Android native solution (Java) and bridged it
   into React Native for startup-grade security requirements.

3. **Subscription-free reverse geocoding**
   Combined iOS free APIs with Android native `android.location.Geocoder`
   via React Native bridges to achieve accuracy without recurring costs.
